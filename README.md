The concept of this assignment was to create an interactive, dynamic, web application that uses 2 server-side API's, accepts user input and returns data, and saves that data to local storage. 

This is a team project. We created an appication that allows the user to find cocktail recipes and food recipes.

User Story:
- As a user, I want to search for recipes to make both meals and alcholic beverages
- So that I can be shown recipes and drinks that I searched for
- When I find a recipe that I want to bookmark, I can save it for the next time I visit the application
