The concept of this assignment was to create an interactive, dynamic, web application that uses 2 server-side API's, and accepts user input and returns data.

This is a team project. We created an appication that allows the user to find cocktail recipes and food recipes. Strategically, our application only displays 3 recipes, to mitigate the decision making process and enhance the simplicity of making a decision.

User Story:
- As a user, I want to search for recipes to make both meals and alcholic beverages
- So that I can be shown recipes and drinks that I searched for
- When I find a recipe/drink that I want to make, I can see the ingredients, measurements, and instructions to make the drink/recipe

# Technologies

The technolgies used in this were HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Bootstrap, GitHub, GitHub Pages, Computer Terminal

# Future Development

Creating a save feature within the card so that when a user wants to save a specific recipe or cocktail, they can save it and it will be saved in local storage
